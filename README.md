# gecko-solo-py
A simple wrapper around the gecko terminal api tailored for my most use cases. You might find it useful in projects where you need pool and token information of projects accross several blockchain platforms

This was thought to be released a series of script but now would be released as a library. but with an `examples` folder to hold the scripts. 
Can derive further useful examples from this scripts. I would also accept contribution for more examples.
